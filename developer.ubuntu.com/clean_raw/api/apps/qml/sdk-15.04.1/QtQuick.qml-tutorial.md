<p>Through the different steps of this tutorial we will learn about QML basic types, we will create our own QML component with properties and signals, and we will create a simple animation with the help of states and transitions.</p>
<p>Chapter one starts with a minimal &quot;Hello world&quot; program and the following chapters introduce new concepts.</p>
