<p>This tutorial walks step-by-step through the creation of a full application using QML. It assumes that you already know the basics of QML (for example, from reading the <a href="QtQuick.qml-tutorial.md">simple tutorial</a>).</p>
<p>In this tutorial we write a game, <i>Same Game</i>, based on the Same Game application included in the declarative <code>examples</code> directory, which looks like this:</p>

<p>An understanding of JavaScript is helpful to understand parts of this tutorial, but if you don't know JavaScript you can still get a feel for how you can integrate backend logic to create and control QML types.</p>
