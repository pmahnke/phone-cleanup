<p>Most applications will have data that needs to be displayed to the user. That data might come from a variety of sources: network sources, local files, and databases are all common sources of data.</p>
<h2 id="models-and-views">Models and Views</h2>
<p>It is often advantageous to show similar data in a similar manner, within an application, and this gives rise to the idea of having a model which contains data, and a view which displays the data. The view will display a delegate for every datum in the model.</p>
<p>For information about how the Model/View paradigm is implemented in Qt Quick, see the page titled <a href="QtQuick.qtquick-modelviewsdata-modelview.md">Models and Views in Qt Quick</a>.</p>
<h2 id="data-storage-and-access">Data Storage and Access</h2>
<p>Databases are commonly used to store information in applications. Qt Quick provides simplified access to relational databases via the <a href="QtQuick.qtquick-releasenotes.md#qtquick-localstorage">QtQuick.LocalStorage</a> module.</p>
