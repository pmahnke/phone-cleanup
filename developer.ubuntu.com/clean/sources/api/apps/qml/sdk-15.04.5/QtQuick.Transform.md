Detailed Description
--------------------

The Transform type is a base type which cannot be instantiated directly. The following concrete Transform types are available:

-   [Rotation](../QtQuick.Rotation.md)
-   [Scale](../QtQuick.Scale.md)
-   [Translate](../QtQuick.Translate.md)

The Transform types let you create and control advanced transformations that can be configured independently using specialized properties.

You can assign any number of Transforms to an [Item](../QtQuick.Item.md). Each Transform is applied in order, one at a time.
