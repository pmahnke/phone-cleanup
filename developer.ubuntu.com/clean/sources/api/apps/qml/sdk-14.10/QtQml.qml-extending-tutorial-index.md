Writing QML Extensions with C++
===============================

<span class="subtitle"></span>
<span id="details"></span>
The [Qt QML](../QtQml.qtqml-index.md) module provides a set of APIs for extending QML through C++ extensions. You can write extensions to add your own QML types, extend existing Qt types, or call C/C++ functions that are not accessible from ordinary QML code.

This tutorial shows how to write a QML extension using C++ that includes core QML features, including properties, signals and bindings. It also shows how extensions can be deployed through plugins.

You can find the source code for this tutorial in `Qt`'s examples/qml/tutorials/extending directory.
