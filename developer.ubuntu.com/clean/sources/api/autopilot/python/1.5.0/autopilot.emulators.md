Autopilot Says

**Deprecated Namespace!**

This module contains modules that were in the `autopilot.emulators` package in autopilot version 1.2 and earlier, but have now been moved to the `autopilot` package.

This module exists to ease the transition to autopilot 1.3, but is not guaranteed to exist in the future.
