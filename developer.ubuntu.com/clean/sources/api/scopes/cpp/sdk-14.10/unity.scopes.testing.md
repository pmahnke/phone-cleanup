        [AndersonDarlingTest](../unity.scopes.testing.AndersonDarlingTest.md)  
Implements the Anderson-Darling test for normality for the case of empirical mean and variance.

[Benchmark](../unity.scopes.testing.Benchmark.md)  
The Benchmark class defines an interface to provide scope authors with runtime benchmarking capabilities to be used in their own testing.

[Category](../unity.scopes.testing.Category.md)  
Implementation of Category class for testing.

[InProcessBenchmark](../unity.scopes.testing.InProcessBenchmark.md)  
The InProcessBenchmark class provides scope authors with runtime benchmarking capabilities. The actual runs are executed in the same process.

[OutOfProcessBenchmark](../unity.scopes.testing.OutOfProcessBenchmark.md)  
The OutOfProcessBenchmark class provides scope authors with runtime benchmarking capabilities. The actual runs are executed in another process.

[Result](../unity.scopes.testing.Result.md)  
A simple class implementation of unity::scopes::Result that provides a default constructor.

[Sample](../unity.scopes.testing.Sample.md)  
The Sample class models the interface to a sample of raw observations and their statistical properties.

[StudentsTTest](../unity.scopes.testing.StudentsTTest.md)  
Implements different variants of the Student's T-test (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's\_t-test)
