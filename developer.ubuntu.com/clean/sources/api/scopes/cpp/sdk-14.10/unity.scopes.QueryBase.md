Called by the scopes run time when the query originator cancels a query.

Your implementation of this method should ensure that the scope stops processing the current query as soon as possible. Any calls to a `push()` method once a query is cancelled are ignored, so continuing to push after cancellation only wastes CPU cycles. (`push()` returns `false` once a query is cancelled or exceeds its cardinality limit.)

Implemented in <a href="unity.scopes.ActivationQueryBase.md#af9b8e83ac6716db51aba942aca9cc6be">unity::scopes::ActivationQueryBase</a>.

Returns a dictionary with the scope's current settings.

Instead of storing the return value, it is preferable to call <a href="#ab6a25ba587387a7f490b8b5a081e9ed6" title="Returns a dictionary with the scope&#39;s current settings. ">settings()</a> each time your implementation requires a settings value. This ensures that, if a user changes settings while the scope is running, the new settings take effect with the next query, preview, and so on.

Note  
The settings are available only after this <a href="index.html" title="Abstract server-side base interface for a query that is executed inside a scope. ">QueryBase</a> is instantiated; do not call this method from the constructor!

Check whether this query is still valid.

<a href="#a095e61eabe2042eeea5c4df1a444d7d4" title="Check whether this query is still valid. ">valid()</a> returns false if this query is finished or was cancelled earlier. Note that it is possible that the run time may call <a href="unity.scopes.SearchQueryBase.md#afc4f15b2266838d7da75b05ea37d504b" title="Called by scopes run time to start the query.

Your implementation of these methods should check whether the query is still valid and, if not, do nothing.

This method is provided mainly for convenience: it can be used in your s `run()` or `activate()` implementation to avoid doing a lot of work setting up a query that was cancelled earlier. Note that, because cancellation can happen at any time during query execution, your implementation should always test the return value of `push()`. If `push()` returns `false`, the query was either cancelled or exceeded its cardinality limit. Either way, there is no point in continuing to push more results because, once `push()` returns `false`, the scopes run time discards all subsequent results for the query.
